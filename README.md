# Web Vulnerability Scanner Framework (WVSF)
Web Application Security Scanner Framework 

This tool is high-performance Ruby framework aimed towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of web applications.

It is designed to automatically detect security issues in web applications. All it expects is the URL of the target website and after a while it will present you with its findings.

# WVSF Offer:

A stable, efficient, high-performance framework

Check, report and plugin developers are allowed to easily and quickly create and deploy their components with the minimum amount of restrictions imposed upon them, while provided with the necessary infrastructure to accomplish their goals.

Furthermore, they are encouraged to take full advantage of the Ruby language under a unified framework that will increase their productivity without stifling them or complicating their tasks.

Moreover, that same framework can be utilized as any other Ruby library and lead to the development of brand new scanners or help you create highly customized scan/audit scenarios and/or scripted scans.
# Features:

# REST API

    Very simple and straightforward API.
    Easy interoperability with non-Ruby systems.
        Operates over HTTP.
        Uses JSON to format messages.
    Stateful scan monitoring.
        Unique sessions automatically only receive updates when polling for progress, rather than full data.

# RPC API

    High-performance/low-bandwidth communication protocol.
        MessagePack serialization for performance, efficiency and ease of integration with 3rd party systems.
    Grid:
        Self-healing.
        Scale up/down by hot-plugging/hot-unplugging nodes.
            Can scale up infinitely by adding nodes to increase scan capacity.
        (Always-on) Load-balancing -- All Instances are automatically provided by the least burdened Grid member.
            With optional per-scan opt-out/override.
        (Optional) High-Performance mode -- Combines the resources of multiple nodes to perform multi-Instance scans.
            Enabled on a per-scan basis.

# Components
WVSF is a highly modular system, employing several components of distinct types to perform its duties.
In addition to enabling or disabling the bundled components so as to adjust the system's behavior and features as needed, functionality can be extended via the addition of user-created components to suit almost every need.

# Platform fingerprinters

In order to make efficient use of the available bandwidth, WVSF performs rudimentary platform fingerprinting and tailors the audit process to the server-side deployed technologies by only using applicable payloads.

Currently, the following platforms can be identified:

   # Operating systems
        BSD
        Linux
        Unix
        Windows
        Solaris
